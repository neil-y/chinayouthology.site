		<h2>Can I trust your insights and inspiration?<br />Trustable insights from a youth insider.</h2>
		<h3>Why a youth insider?</h3>
		<h4>1.Through us, your eyes are in the neighbourhood, not surveying from a helicopter.</h4>
		<p>How can you be sure if you understand a person or a situation is accurately? Just like getting to know a neighbourhood, a person who drops in for a visit may be able to learn the street names, the name of stores, and the layout of the environment. But only a native resident of the neighbourhood can tell you the names of the other residence, their history, the relationships, whats really changing, and whats really important in the neighbourhood. It takes a local insider to unveil the meanings that are truly relevant and impactful to the individual.</p>
		<h4>2. Accepted by youth. Informed, updated.</h4>
		<p>We are constantly immersed in youth culture, day in, day out. Playing with them, living with them, talking with them, feeling with them. 
		Because we are accepted as part of Chinese youth culture, we go deeper than other researchers into the lives and intimate spaces of youth.</p>
		<h4>3. Interpretation is more accurate</h4>
		<p>Because we observe their life behaviours continually and deeply, we are able to filter, decode, and discover the true core tensions that are driving and influencing youth today.</p>
		<h3>How?</h3>
		<h4>1. Open Youthology</h4>
		<p>We've built a platform that generates, collects, curates and shares youth stories with the youth community. In doing so we play a role in youth culture, are able to build trust with youth, go deeper into their lives, and connect with the new ideas and peoples that influence Chinese youth today. For more, go to <a href="openyouthology.html">Open Youthology &gt;&gt;</a></p>
		<h4>2. Build personal connection in every contact with participants</h4>
		<p>It's who we are. As researchers who see participants not just as respondents but as a holistic individual, don't just ask questions, we build relationships. 
		For more, go to <a href="about.html">About Us &gt;&gt;</a></p>
		<h4>3. Continuous foundation research</h4>
		<p>We're not starting from scratch each time we begin a new exploration. Because we're exclusively focused on youth, we've built an extensive wealth of knowledge about youth that gives us immediate context and deeper perspective about the research direction. We start already several steps ahead, and so are able to go deeper, faster.</p>
		<h4>For more on our wealth of knowledge, learn more about:</h4>

		<h2>Why do I need to think 'culturally'?<br />A cultural perspective reveals distinctive opportunities.</h2>
		<h3>Why?</h3>
		<h4>1.Not the traditional psychological territories, but new 'blue oceans' of meanings.</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Do you really find the 'feelings/emotions' and 'personality archetypes' helpful for your brand to be distinctive from competitors and relevant to consumers? How does 'excitement', 'peace of mind', 'confident', 'progressive', 'outgoing' etc. mean differently to Chinese youth than to other demographic groups? </li>
			<li>Coming from a cultural and social perspective, the insights should always bear rich connotation about the context, to help you understand the meanings and the drivers that matter.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>2. More than the high and empty words, but vividness and richness of cultural expression</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Coming from a cultural perspective, we believe only stories and rich cultural representations can help deliver the ideas accurately (both for us to deliver insights to client, and for client to eventually deliver their ideas to consumers)</li>
			<li>Our insights come with vividness and richness of youth stories</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>How?</h3>
		<h4>1. Anthropological perspective â€“ We dive deep into the exploration and interpretation of nuanced meanings and practices</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Ethnographies of youth activities and occasions</li>
			<li>Eliciting stories, not asking questions</li>
			<li>Generative exercises to reveal inner worlds</li>
			<li>Semiotic analysis of influential discourse and media</li>
			<li>Netnographies exploration of online relationships, identities, and influence</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>2. Sociological perspective - We look to understand how the major societal changes have driven the values and needs of Chinese youth</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Exhaustive desk research</li>
			<li>Consult and converse with an expert network of thought leaders such as scholars, journalists, and artists</li>
			<li>Follow leading media</li>
