				<div class="about1">
					<h3>Our Story</h3>
					<p>In 2008 a group of young, geeky explorers who love to ask questions, gathered together to found China Youthology. We are compelled to ask the questions that a new generation are beginning to explore.  Right now Chinese youth are exploring new values, lifestyles, and relationships, and they are searching for support and guidance. Exploring these questions are as much for ourselves as they are for youth. But China Youthology was founded also because we see big opportunity for brands to connect and be more meaningful to youth. We believe brands have an important role to play in youth's lives, and by asking questions with youth, we endeavour to bring brands into relevance. </p>
					<h4>The DNA of China Youthology is Youth and Ology – Research.</h4>
					<p>Youth is an attitude regardless of age - embrace curiosity, believe in possibilities, challenge norms, and dare to dream. We love youth culture. We champion the youth voice. We are youth. Research is our pursuit. We search for truth and we believe insights lead to change.</p>
					<h4>Our expectation on impact to youth</h4>
					<p>We share insights to youth to inspire youth discovery and encourage them to act on their life meanings. In our day to day research practice, we respect youth, build personal relationships, and inspire them.</p>
					<h4>Our expectation on impact to brands</h4>
					<p>We share insights and facilitate their use to help brands be relevant and meaningful to youth. We believe lasting competitive advantage comes from brands being closer to the people, truly understanding their needs, selling on a human level, and making commerce a relationship of mutual value creation. We hope consumer culture can be a positive force for change in Chinese youth culture, spreading useful ideas and tools.</p>

		<h2>Can I trust your insights and inspiration?<br />Trustable insights from a youth insider.</h2>
		<h3>Why a youth insider?</h3>
		<h4>1.Through us, your eyes are in the neighbourhood, not surveying from a helicopter.</h4>
		<p>How can you be sure if you understand a person or a situation is accurately? Just like getting to know a neighbourhood, a person who drops in for a visit may be able to learn the street names, the name of stores, and the layout of the environment. But only a native resident of the neighbourhood can tell you the names of the other residence, their history, the relationships, whats really changing, and whats really important in the neighbourhood. It takes a local insider to unveil the meanings that are truly relevant and impactful to the individual.</p>
		<h4>2. Accepted by youth. Informed, updated.</h4>
		<p>We are constantly immersed in youth culture, day in, day out. Playing with them, living with them, talking with them, feeling with them. 
		Because we are accepted as part of Chinese youth culture, we go deeper than other researchers into the lives and intimate spaces of youth.</p>
		<h4>3. Interpretation is more accurate</h4>
		<p>Because we observe their life behaviours continually and deeply, we are able to filter, decode, and discover the true core tensions that are driving and influencing youth today.</p>
		<h3>How?</h3>
		<h4>1. Open Youthology</h4>
		<p>We've built a platform that generates, collects, curates and shares youth stories with the youth community. In doing so we play a role in youth culture, are able to build trust with youth, go deeper into their lives, and connect with the new ideas and peoples that influence Chinese youth today. For more, go to <a href="openyouthology.html">Open Youthology &gt;&gt;</a></p>
		<h4>2. Build personal connection in every contact with participants</h4>
		<p>It's who we are. As researchers who see participants not just as respondents but as a holistic individual, don't just ask questions, we build relationships. 
		For more, go to <a href="about.html">About Us &gt;&gt;</a></p>
		<h4>3. Continuous foundation research</h4>
		<p>We're not starting from scratch each time we begin a new exploration. Because we're exclusively focused on youth, we've built an extensive wealth of knowledge about youth that gives us immediate context and deeper perspective about the research direction. We start already several steps ahead, and so are able to go deeper, faster.</p>

		<h4>2. Accepted by youth. Informed, updated.</h4>
		<p>We are constantly immersed in youth culture, day in, day out. Playing with them, living with them, talking with them, feeling with them. 
		Because we are accepted as part of Chinese youth culture, we go deeper than other researchers into the lives and intimate spaces of youth.</p>
		<h4>3. Interpretation is more accurate</h4>
		<p>Because we observe their life behaviours continually and deeply, we are able to filter, decode, and discover the true core tensions that are driving and influencing youth today.</p>
		<h3>How?</h3>
		<h4>1. Open Youthology</h4>
		<p>We've built a platform that generates, collects, curates and shares youth stories with the youth community. In doing so we play a role in youth culture, are able to build trust with youth, go deeper into their lives, and connect with the new ideas and peoples that influence Chinese youth today. For more, go to <a href="openyouthology.html">Open Youthology &gt;&gt;</a></p>
		<h4>2. Build personal connection in every contact with participants</h4>
		<p>It's who we are. As researchers who see participants not just as respondents but as a holistic individual, don't just ask questions, we build relationships. 
		For more, go to <a href="about.html">About Us &gt;&gt;</a></p>
		<h4>3. Continuous foundation research</h4>
		<p>We're not starting from scratch each time we begin a new exploration. Because we're exclusively focused on youth, we've built an extensive wealth of knowledge about youth that gives us immediate context and deeper perspective about the research direction. We start already several steps ahead, and so are able to go deeper, faster.</p>

		<h2>Can I trust your insights and inspiration?<br />Trustable insights from a youth insider.</h2>
		<h3>Why a youth insider?</h3>
		<h4>1.Through us, your eyes are in the neighbourhood, not surveying from a helicopter.</h4>
		<p>How can you be sure if you understand a person or a situation is accurately? Just like getting to know a neighbourhood, a person who drops in for a visit may be able to learn the street names, the name of stores, and the layout of the environment. But only a native resident of the neighbourhood can tell you the names of the other residence, their history, the relationships, whats really changing, and whats really important in the neighbourhood. It takes a local insider to unveil the meanings that are truly relevant and impactful to the individual.</p>
